# Stock Price Notifier

This is a small application as a project as a part of the Udemy Course <a href="https://eylearning.udemy.com/course/automate-everything-with-python">*Automate Everything with Python*</a> by *Ardit Sulce*.
This application continuously scrapes the stock price change percentage from <a href="https://zse.hr/en/indeks-366/365?isin=HRZB00ICBEX6">this website</a>. If the percentage goes less than -0.12%, the application will send an e-mail.
